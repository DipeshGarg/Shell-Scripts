# Shell-Scripts
Some of my personal automation shell scripts.

# Syntax of all scripts
./Sub-Enum-Script.sh <filename containing all domains>
 { This script takes a file containing all domains and enumerate subdomains for each of them using multiple tools as Subfinder , Assetfinder , Amass. Then after sorting them it check for alive subdomains and gives you 2 files one with all subdomains and other with alive ones. }
